# Transactions visualization

Pre-requisites:
To run the app make sure that the backend api is running. You could update server url in the `.env` file.
If backend would be hosted on different host then the client, make sure that the backend server sends necessary headers to resolve cors issues.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
Standard way of creating production ready build of the app is to run - `yarn build`, though the others were preserved for the potential extensions for the future - `yarn test`, `yarn start`.
