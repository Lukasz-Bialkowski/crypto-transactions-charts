# Transactions visualization

Pre-requisites:
To run the app make sure that the backend api is reachable. To do that update `.env` and provide the correct url and port.
If backend would be hosted on different host then the client, make sure that the backend server sends necessary allowance headers to resolve cors issues.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) which means that to build the production ready build of the app you could run - `yarn build`.
